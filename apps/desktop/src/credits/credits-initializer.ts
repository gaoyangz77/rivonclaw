/**
 * Credits Initializer
 *
 * On startup, when access_mode is "credits":
 *  1. Calls cloud-api /api/auth/device with the device ID to obtain a JWT + balance.
 *  2. Caches the JWT in settings as `credits_token`.
 *  3. Stores the JWT in secretStore as `openrouter-api-key` so that OpenClaw
 *     uses it as the Authorization: Bearer header when calling the openrouter provider.
 *
 * HOW OPENROUTER PROXY ROUTING IS CONFIGURED (Option B — custom provider override):
 *
 * The gateway config writer's `extraProviders` option writes to
 * `models.providers.<name>` in openclaw.json, which overrides any built-in
 * provider definition (including the native `openrouter` entry at
 * https://openrouter.ai/api/v1).  We inject an `openrouter` entry whose
 * `baseUrl` points at our cloud-api proxy:
 *
 *   baseUrl = "${CLOUD_API_URL}/api/proxy/openrouter"
 *
 * OpenClaw's `openai-completions` api handler appends "/chat/completions" to
 * baseUrl, producing:
 *
 *   POST ${CLOUD_API_URL}/api/proxy/openrouter/chat/completions
 *
 * NOTE: The cloud-api proxy currently only handles `POST /api/proxy/openrouter`.
 * To make the override fully functional end-to-end, the cloud-api proxy should
 * also accept `POST /api/proxy/openrouter/chat/completions` (or a wildcard
 * under that path).  Until then, direct openrouter requests from OpenClaw will
 * reach the right server but hit a 404 for the sub-path.
 *
 * The JWT is also written as `openrouter-api-key` in secretStore so that
 * OpenClaw forwards it as the Authorization header on every request, letting
 * cloud-api authenticate the user via its auth middleware.
